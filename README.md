DESCRIPTION:                                                                            
                                                                                                    
This depository includes all estimated tree and trunk/stem parameters used in the manuscript under review titled: Maximum heat ratio: bi-directional method for fast and slow sap flow measurements


This repository contains: 

CRBasics (folder)

This folder contains the CRbasic programs used to collect data. All are old/discontinued versions. Overtime, we have developed better, more elaborate scripts that I intend to make publicly available

Data (folder)

This folder contains all processed/estimated data such as heat pulse velocity, sap flux density and all data associated to thermal properties

I am also making available all gravimetric data collected, in their original format
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
SAP FLOW DATA PROCESS:                                                                        
 - Sap flow method used: heat pulse velocity, heat ratio and maximum heat ratio
 - Thermal properties, used to estimated volumetric water content, were estimated via curve-fitting heat conduction-convectione equations (see manuscript for details)
